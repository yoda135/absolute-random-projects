# absolute-random-projects
this is a repo just full of the most horribly coded random projects I've ever done

Note:
`This repo is not just one project, it is a cominbation of many that I have made over the years, dating far back. Feel free to take a look at these and tinker.`

**Some of these projects are un checked and I am not 100% sure what some of them are, they have just beeen added to this repo. Let me know if you find any bugs or issues and I will try my best to help out.**
